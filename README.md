A simple datapack for Minecraft 1.20.1 that used to configure Curios API slots

To configure slots go to "curiosbalance\data\curiosbalance\functions\curiosbalancecommand.mcfunction"
1. Change command "curios set (and so on...)"
2. set your curio identifier, for example bracelet
3. set size that you want, for example 1

Should work with any Curios API version and any further Minecraft versions just change "pack_format" field in "pack.mcmeta" file
